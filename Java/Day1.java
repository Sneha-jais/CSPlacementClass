/*
IDE=Syntax analyser+compiler+run (Integrated development Environment)
JRE=java runtime environment (Provide all facility to run java program easily)

1. JDK (Java development kit, it is plateform dependent, it will run automatically)
2. Compiler (JDK as well as )
3. JVM (java virtual machine, it is plateform dependent but it makes the java program to platefom independent)


java program run krne k baad ek .class(that is being called BYTE CODE) file generate hogi that will be PLATEFORM INDEPENDENT
Thus java is PLATEFORM INDEPENDENT
